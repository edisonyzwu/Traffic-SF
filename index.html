    <h1>San Francisco Traffic Deaths Remain High 10 Years After "Vison Zero"</h1>
    <div id="byline">By Edison Wu | Oct.3, 2024</div>
    <p>
      In 2014, San Francisco committed to "Vision Zero," a bold initiative aimed at eliminating
      traffic deaths within a decade. City officials promised to invest millions of dollars to
      reduce speeds and redesign intersections to prioritize pedestrian safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, a decade later, the results fall short. Data shows that more than twenty-five people
      lost their lives in traffic crashes in San Francisco in 2024, nearly matching the number of
      deaths recorded in 2014.
